# 1. Project Description
## Predicting the Median housing values for different households
### The project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating the Median House Value based on various features related to housing characteristics and geographic location.

### The primary objective for this project is to build a regression model that accurately predicts the Median House Value based on different features.

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 

The following techniques have been used: 

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the numerical variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.
